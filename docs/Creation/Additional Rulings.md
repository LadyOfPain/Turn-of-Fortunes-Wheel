If you've been in my previous games I want to make clear some of the goals I'd like to achieve and why I'd like to achieve them.

## Magic Items are Cool

Magic items are one of the two pillars of player power, and are endlessly interesting tools for both gameplay and design. I intend to give out more of them, and allow players to craft their own magic items through [The Arcane Forge](the-arcane-forge.pdf).

## Gold is Boring

Let's fix that. There will be a number of opportunities to spend gold meaningfully as the game progresses. This includes the construction of magic items, but also through other means I will be keeping close to my chest for now. Hoard gold, and spend it. I am likely to say yes to your ability to buy something. It's just a matter of price.

## Less Resting

I aim to stress the players' resources more. Somewhere around 3-5 encounters per long rest or more. The intent is not to punish players for using their resources, but to encourage them to use them efficiently and creatively. Additionally, stressing the resource economy creates tension and release. Lastly, it allows me to reward players with more resources for successful play, giving them more tools and extrinsic reward. More tension, more reward, bigger payoff.

>**Excursion Resting**
>*Applies while traveling in the wild.*
>
>A short rest can be taken anywhere over course of 8 hours, 6 of which must be spent sleeping, 2 of which be light activity.
>
>Any rest is interrupted by the following:
>- Rolling Initiative
>- Casting a spell with a spell slot other than a contrip
>- Taking any damage
>
>A long rest can be achieved after taking three short rests in a row in the same location without interrupting the rest. Or in a single night in a Safe. haven.

## Downtime

Characters spend a significant amount of time doing nothing while out on adventures. We often wave our hand at that downtime unless there's a specific scene someone wants to play. Most of the time we just say time passes, spinning newspaper, it's the next scene. This is a missed opportunity. I'd like to make downtime more meaningful by giving players something to work towards that typically would take too much time to do on an action-packed adventure. Additionally, if there's to be less resting, let's make it even more impactful.

>[!note]
>**Downtime Jobs**
>
>While spending downtime, you can choose to engage in a downtime job. Downtime jobs can be performed as part of "light activity" during resting. 
>
>1. Pick an objective. The GM will tell you how many hours it will take, the DC for making a breakthrough, and if there is any cost associated.
>2. For every 8 hours you spend on a downtime activity, roll the skill check associated.
>	- On a success, you make a breakthrough and mark an additional 8 hours against the time remaining.
>	- On a critical failure, time or materials may be lost.
>3. Once the time remaining hits 0, you accomplish your goal.

## Becoming Epic

I've want to encourage players to be more directly impactful on the world and its people. Often times the adventures that make up a campaign can be very self-contained. The world proceeds with the status quo. One quest after another. I want accomplishments to come with recognition. I also want heroism to come with responsibility. Players should be rewarded for great deeds by being given great power. That could mean powerful magic items, but more interestingly it should mean influence, politics, and notoriety.

>[!note]
>**Historic Inspiration**
>
>When a historic even occurs, if a player was responsible, they will be awarded a coupon says "Historic Inspiration" on it.
>
>The player can choose to hand in said coupon whenever they're asked to make a d20 roll. Doing so, the player automatically rolls a Natural 20 on the d20.

## Throwdown

I want to encourage players to throw monsters around. I also want to threaten players with monesters that throw *them* around. Abilities that push and pull are generally underwhelming, but don't need changed outside of the fact that the act of forced movement isn't impactful.

>[!note]
>
>**Double Falling**
>
>You take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet fallen. The creature lands prone unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.
>
>If you jump willingly, you roll 4d6 fewer dice when determining falling damage.
