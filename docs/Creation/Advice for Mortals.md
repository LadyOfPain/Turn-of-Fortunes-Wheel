### Inspiration not Perspiration

Seek inspiration from the places and themes in the source material, but do not be overwhelmed by choice. You do not have to read everything. You do not need to include everything.

>[!example]
>The entirety of Eberron is at your disposal. Be inspired by the thesis of Eberron: pulp high fantasy in a war-struck world. Don't worry about creating a lore-accurate character.

### A Theme and a Dream

Pick a theme first. A roleplaying game is about playing a role. Think about what role you want to play. Write down those 3-4 core tenants and adhere to them religiously while creating your character.

>[!example]
>
>Ex: Pirate plasmoid with lots of swords. Is an experiment fusing multiple pirate captains together. Each pirate is searching for the other pirates' treasure. Done.

### The Hero's Journey

Consider conflict, journey, and questions. Create a central question that drives motivation. Consider how that question creates a journey. Think about what conflicts you may face on that journey.

>[!example]
>As an amalgamation of pirate captains, who am I at my core? Finding each of the treasures removes that captain from the plasmoid. Each captain represents a quality of the character. The more treasures that are found, the less of themselves there is, but the more of themselves there is to find. The real treasure was the friends we made along the way.

### Practice Makes Perfect

Write something in your character's voice. An interview, a letter, a first-person account of a memory. The details about what happens are less important than finding how your character speaks. Practice being in their headspace.

### Leave Room for Exploration

Leave holes. No idea is cannon until it's said at the table. Don't answer every question. Leave room for play. Figure it out in the moment. You are allowed to take a moment to think at the table. Come to the table with as little as can get away with.

### Less is More

Cut rather than add. Abide by the core idea of your character. If something doesn't fit, cut it rather than trying to make it work. Art is about what you decide to keep, not what you originally intended.

###  Remember the Game

Focus on play. If your idea doesn't help you play, then it's a character in a book not a character in an RPG. If an idea doesn't contribute to play, cut it. If it isn't fun, throw it out.
